# Lecture Notes

## React
### State and Props
- both are objects in react that allow us to do stuff with data (state)
- State belonged to a component - as such can be changed by the component
- props (belongs to components parent) can't be changed by the component, only used

## State
- a snapshot of the data in it's current condition

### Adding images
- Photos can be imported into react js components in your src folder, just like any other resource
- everything in public is served from our website url, you can use the url as an image source in your component child.jpg `<img src={'./child.jpg} />`
- it will depend on where you work what the style guide prefers you do

## Bootstrap React
- a third party component library we can use to import pre-styled components
- components just like any other component we would make, but with styling already added
- steps:
    - go to bootstrap react web page
    - click getting started
    - grab installation script from the beginning of the page
    - run that in the root of your project
    - see further down on the page where it tells you to `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';` add that line to your index.js OR app.js
    - then explore the component library to see which components you want to use and figure out how to use them
